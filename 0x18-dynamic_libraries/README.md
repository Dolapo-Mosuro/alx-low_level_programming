0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

## Tasks

0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life
mandatory
Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:int _putchar(char c);
int _islower(int c);
int _isalpha(int c);
int _abs(int n);
int _isupper(int c);
int _isdigit(int c);
int _strlen(char *s);
void _puts(char *s);
char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);
int _atoi(char *s);
char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);
char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);
int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);

1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future
mandatory
Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.


2. Let's call C functions from Python
#advanced
I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!

Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. See example for more detail.

julien@ubuntu:~/0x18$ cat 100-tests.py
import random
import ctypes

cops = ctypes.CDLL('./100-operations.so')
a = random.randint(-111, 111)
b = random.randint(-111, 111)
print("{} + {} = {}".format(a, b, cops.add(a, b)))
print("{} - {} = {}".format(a, b, cops.sub(a, b)))
print("{} x {} = {}".format(a, b, cops.mul(a, b)))
print("{} / {} = {}".format(a, b, cops.div(a, b)))
print("{} % {} = {}".format(a, b, cops.mod(a, b)))
julien@ubuntu:~/0x16. Doubly linked lists$ python3 100-tests.py 
66 + -76 = -10
66 - -76 = 142
66 x -76 = -5016
66 / -76 = 0
66 % -76 = 66
julien@ubuntu:~/0x18$ python3 100-tests.py 
-34 + -57 = -91
-34 - -57 = 23
-34 x -57 = 1938
-34 / -57 = 0
-34 % -57 = -34
julien@ubuntu:~/0x18$ python3 100-tests.py 
-5 + -72 = -77
-5 - -72 = 67
-5 x -72 = 360
-5 / -72 = 0
-5 % -72 = -5
julien@ubuntu:~/0x18$ python3 100-tests.py 
39 + -62 = -23
39 - -62 = 101
39 x -62 = -2418
39 / -62 = 0
39 % -62 = 39




3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!
#advanced


I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?

Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it here. Our mole also gave us a piece of documentation:
/* Giga Millions program                                                                                    
  * Players may pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers:                                                
  * - five different numbers from 1 to 75 and                                                                       
  * - one number from 1 to 15                                                                                       
  * You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.                                           
  * Your chances to win the jackpot is 1 in 258,890,850                                                             
  *                                                                                                                 
  * usage: ./gm n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 bonus
You can’t modify the program gm itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its MD5 before running it
The system is an Linux Ubuntu 16.04
The server has internet access
Our mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSS
Your shell script should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use ;, &&, ||, |, ` (it would be detected by MSS), and have a maximum of two commands
Our mole has only the authorization to upload one file on the server. It will be your shell script
Our mole will run your shell script this way: mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh
Our mole will run your shell script from the same directory containing the program gm, exactly 98 seconds before MSS runs gm with my numbers: ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9
MSS will use the same terminal and session than our mole
Before running the gm program, MSS always check the content of the directory
MSS always exit after running the program gm
TL;DR; This is what is going to happen
mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh
mss@gm_server$ rm 101-make_me_win.sh
mss@gm_server$ ls -la
. .. gm
mss@gm_server$ history -c
mss@gm_server$ clear
mss@gm_server$ ls -la
. .. gm
mss@gm_server$ md5sum gm
d52e6c18e0723f5b025a75dea19ef365  gm
mss@gm_server$ ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9
--> Please make me win!
mss@gm_server$ exit
